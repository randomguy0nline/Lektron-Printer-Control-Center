# Lektron-Printer-Control-Center
Software for interfacing with receipt printers inside arcade machines

this software requires an OS with 16 bit support. Windows 10 32 bit with NTVDM enabled in the add/remove features menu works fine.

This also requires the installation of Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0 on the same system for all of the drivers necessairy.
